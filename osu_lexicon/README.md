This is a script to process a piece of lightly-processed HTML from https://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/
===============

It checks with authors from the Lexicon have articles on Hebrew and English Wikipedia.
Requires Ruby 2.0 or higher, due to Unicode literals in the code. (I'm lazy.)

TODO
====

* Make it slurp and process https://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/ itself, rather than the edited copy
* improve handling of parentheses in names
* upload directly to a userspace page on-wiki?
